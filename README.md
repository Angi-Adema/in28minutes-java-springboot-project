# in28minutes-java-springboot-project

## About

This simple game application was created to explore the different aspects of Spring Boot. It was created while following along with Learn Spring Boot in 28 Minutes by Ranga Karanam. This particular project
looked at how to start a Spring Boot project through Spring Initializr. Then we looked at the difference between tight coupling and loose coupling in our programs, we defined Spring Boot terminology to
build the project including Maven and how this simplifies dependencies needed for our application. We then looked at the dependency injection through constructor, field and setter injection methods.
